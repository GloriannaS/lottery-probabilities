    "\n",
    "In this project, we will demonstrate how to use various probability tools for data analysis. By the end, we aim to highlight the importance and value of probabilities in predicting and analyzing data.\n",

    "#### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is based on a hypothetical situation in which a medical institute is developing an app designed to predict the likelihood of winning the lottery. The app specifically targets individuals who struggle with lottery addiction. The goal is to help these individuals understand the actual odds of winning, which may assist them in overcoming their addiction and prevent them from falling deeper into debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our role in this project is to serve as the underlying logic of the app. We will provide answers to hypothetical lottery questions using the same calculations that the app would employ.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, we will be addressing numerous probability questions throughout this project. To do this effectively, we will need to utilize specific probability functions multiple times. Therefore, our first step will be to define the two functions outlined below.\n",

We are focusing on a 6/49 lottery, where six numbers are drawn from a set of 49 numbers, ranging from one to 49. A player wins the grand prize if the six numbers on their ticket match all six numbers drawn, and they must be in the exact order as drawn.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we developed four main functions for the initial version of an app designed for lottery enthusiasts. These functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `one_ticket_probability()` — calculates the probability of winning the grand prize with a single ticket\n",
    "- `check_historical_occurrence()` — checks whether a specific combination has appeared in the Canadian lottery dataset\n",
    "- `multi_ticket_probability()` — calculates the probability for any number of tickets between 1 and 13,983,816\n",
    "- `probability_less_6()` — calculates the probability of having exactly two, three, four, or five winning numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "One of our primary objectives was to illustrate the value of using probability techniques when analyzing data. Although this project is small, it effectively demonstrates how probabilities can provide a clear and concise understanding of the overall data landscape. Additionally, these techniques enable us to create more complex and comprehensive functions that would be quite challenging to develop without a solid understanding of probabilities. Overall, probabilities serve as a versatile and practical tool, useful for a variety of tasks, including exploration, analysis, and prediction."
